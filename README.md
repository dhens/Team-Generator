## Installation:
1. Clone repo to your local machine
2. Run "npm install" in the directory of the cloned repo

## This repo contains:
* This README
* A test-drive-developed CLI app that takes in user input such as name, email, github username, ID, and office phone number

## Known Issues / Bugs
* Styling hasn't been done past defaults provided by template
* Output directory didn't work as expect, and the output file as such is placed in the root folder when exported

## What I Learned:
* Test-driven-development feels like *magic* and allows you to write code like a champ

* [Jest 24.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
